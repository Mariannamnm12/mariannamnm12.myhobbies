    <p><center>My top 3 hobbies are reading, lifting and napping</center></p>
    <h1><center>Reading</center></h1>
    <p><center>Reading is probably my favorite hobby out of the 3 that 
    I mentioned, but I cant do it as often because I dont have a lot of free time</center></p>
    <p><center>Some of my favorite books are The Song of Achilles, I'll give You The Sun 
    and The Midnight Library</center></p>
     <h1><center>Lifting</center></h1>
    <p>I started lifting junior year of high school for soccer but I didnt start taking it 
    seriously until abot a year ago. I have a love-hate relationship with lifting
    because when though it has a lot of health benefits, doing the same routine
    can get very boring</p>
    <h1><center>Napping</center></h1>
    <p>Some people might not consider napping a hobby, but I do.
    I love to nap and if I could I would take nap every single day for the rest of my life.
    Everyone around me knows that my mood fully relies on whether I had a nap or not and that
    i should not be woken up from my nap unless someone is dying. I wish we had nap time in school
    I think everyone's grades would be a lot better</p>
